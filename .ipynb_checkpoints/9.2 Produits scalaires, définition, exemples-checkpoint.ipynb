    "Notions of length, distance, and orthogonality are often important in applications involving a vector space. For $\\mathbb{R}^n$, these concepts were based on the properties of the inner product listed in Theorem1 of Section 6.1. For other spaces, we need analogues of the inner product with the same properties. The conclusions of Theorem 1 now become *axioms* in the following deﬁnition.\n",

    "An **inner product** on a vector space $V$ is a function that, to each pair of vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ in $V$, associates a real number $\\langle\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}\\rangle$ and satisﬁes the following axioms, for all $\\mathbf{u}$, $\\mathbf{v}$,and $\\mathbf{w}$ in $V$ and all scalars $c$: \n",
